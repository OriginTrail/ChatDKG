# ChatDKG example - dRAG (Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Google Gemini and OriginTrail DKG

This dRAG example focuses on art Knowledge Assets, using Google Gemini via the Google Vertex platform. We will query data from the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), which contains easily discoverable and verifiable Knowledge Assets. Once we retrieve relevant Knowledge Assets from the DKG, we will feed them to Google Gemini LLM to generate a response to our natural language question about the artworks in the graph.
